Spring-Mass System Simulation
Project Overview
This project simulates and visualizes a simple spring-mass system using Python. The system consists of a mass connected to a fixed wall by a spring, modeled by Hooke’s Law. The code solves the system’s ordinary differential equation (ODE) to show the motion of the mass over time.

The project includes:

Numerical simulation of the spring-mass motion using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp

Displacement and velocity plotting with matplotlib

An animation visualizing the mass moving on the spring

Features
Models a simple, undamped spring-mass system

Visualizes displacement and velocity over time

Animates the movement of the mass to provide intuitive understanding

Requirements
Install the following Python packages:

numpy

scipy

matplotlib
